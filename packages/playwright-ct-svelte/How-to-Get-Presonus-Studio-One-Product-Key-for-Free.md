## Using the Free Version
 
The free version of Presonus Studio One is called Studio One Free. It is a free-to-use version of the software that can be used by anyone. Registration with Presonus is required to obtain a license for Studio One Free. You can download it from [here](https://www.presonus.com/products/studio-one/get-studio-one).
 
Studio One Free has some limitations compared to the paid versions of the software. For example, it only supports stereo audio input and output, it has fewer effects and instruments, and it does not have advanced features like mastering and notation. However, it still has many useful functions like drag-and-drop workflow, unlimited tracks, MIDI editing, and basic mixing tools.
